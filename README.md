# Scraping Product Data from an Online Shop Using R

In this notebook, I scrape product data (of beach dresses) from the German online shop Otto.de. I'm using the R package rvest plus the Chrome plugin SelectorGadget for scraping. Truth be told, it didn't actually work all that well on this website, but hey, it's my first attempt at webscraping using R.
